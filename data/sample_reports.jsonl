{"report_id": "rpt_002", "text": "CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST FINDINGS: Brain Parenchyma: Redemonstration of large right PICA territory infarct with significant swelling resulting in complete effacement of the fourth ventricular outflow tract. There is also mild right cerebellar tonsillar descent. The mass effect is not significantly changed compared with the prior head CT. There are new areas of confluent hypodensity within the infarct, likely reflecting petechial hemorrhage (HI2), contrast staining from the prior CTA could contribute, but is considered less likely. No evidence of a new acute infarct. Ventricular System and Extra-Axial Spaces: Mild interval enlargement of the ventricles. For example, the bodies of the lateral ventricles measure 10 mm on the right and 9 mm on the left, compared with 7 mm and 6 mm on the prior CT. The third ventricle now measures 8 mm, previously 5 mm. There is new slight dilatation of the temporal horns. No extra-axial collections. No midline shift. Osseous and Extracranial Structures: Normal. No significant paranasal sinus disease. No orbital abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. New areas of confluent hypodensity within the large right PICA territory infarct, likely reflecting petechial hemorrhage (HI2). 2.

Images were reconstructed in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. COMPARISON: CT head dated, MRI brain dated FINDINGS: Brain Parenchyma, Ventricular System, and Extra-Axial Spaces: Expected evolution of a known right PICA territory infarct with similar hemorrhagic transformation. There is continued associated edema with resultant local mass effect that partially effaces the fourth ventricle and basal cisterns. Similar mild leftward midline shift of the posterior fossa with continued inferior displacement of the right cerebellar tonsil. However, there has been mild interval decrease in the caliber of the third and lateral ventricles, for instance the bifrontal span measures 37 from 38 mm. No evidence for periventricular hypoattenuation to suggest transependymal flow of CSF. No supratentorial midline shift. The remaining brain parenchyma is without evidence of new acute territorial infarction or new site of intracranial hemorrhage. A punctate hypoattenuation in the right corona radiata (2; 35) likely represents a prominent perivascular space based on the prior MRI study.
