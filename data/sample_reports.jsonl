Note: Initial 7T study performed on this patient. \n2.  Sensitivity of 7T imaging is different from lower field imaging, which may\nalter the accuracy for lesion detection and assessment of interval changes.\n3.  No interval change of white matter lesions which are nonspecific in\nappearance. One tiny left frontal lesion may have a central vein sign, but the\nmajority of white matter lesions do not. Also, lesions in the left parietal and\ntemporal lobes demonstrate peripheral susceptibility artifact, consistent with\nchronic blood products or mineralization, which is not typical for MS. No new or\nenhancing lesions are demonstrated.\n4.  Stable postoperative findings of right anterior temporal lobectomy."}
